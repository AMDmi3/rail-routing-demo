                             Rail routing demo
                            ===================

This is an an excerpt from my set of C++ OSM processing tools which
implements railroad router.

Repo structure
==============

  Base classes for OSM objects
    * osmtypes.h
    * ObjectBases.hh
    * Objects.hh

  Base class for multipass OSM XML parser
    * ParserBase.hh

  Geographic math functions, namely distance and azimuth calculation
    * geomath.hh

  Custom container with effecient lazy initialization
    * lazyinit_array.hh

  Custom memory pool container
    * pool.hh

  Routing implementation itself
    * railrouting.cc
    * railrouting.hh

  Demonstration program
    * raildemo.cc
    * raildemo.osm

Requirements
============

  * Expat XML parser library with headers
  * CMake
  * C++ compiler with c++0x support (gcc>=4.6)

Building
========

   cmake . && make

Running
=======

  ./raildemo raildemo.osm

  This will load bundled raildemo.osm file with small part of Moscow
  rail network and find a route between two hardcored stations.
